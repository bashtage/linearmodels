    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulas provide an alternative method to specify a model.  The formulas used here utilize [patsy](http://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are similar to those in [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org), although they use an ehnanced syntax to allow identification of endogenous regressors.  The basis formula syntax for a single variable regression would be\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y ~ 1 + x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the `1` indicates that a constant should be included and `x` is the regressor.  In the context of an instrumental variables model, it is necessary to mark variables as endogenous and to provide a list of instruments that are included only in the model for the endogenous variables.  In a basic single regressor model, this would be specified using `[]` to surround an inner model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y ~ 1 + [x ~ z]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression, `x` is now marked as endogenous and `z` is an instrument.  Any exogenous variable will automatically be used when instrumenting `x` so there is no need to repeat these here (in this example, the \"first stage\" would include a constant and z).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Endogenous Variables\n",
    "Multiple endogenos variables are specified in a similar manner.  The basic concept is that any model can be expressed as \n",
    "```\n",
    "dep ~ exog + [ endog ~ instruments]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and it must be the case that \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dep ~ exog + endog\n",
    "```\n",
    "and\n",
    "```\n",
    "dep ~ exog + instruments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "are valid patsy formulas. This means that multiple endogenous regressors or instruments should be joined with `+`, but that the first endogenous or first instrument should not have a leading `+`.  A simple example wiht 2 endogenous variables and 3 instruments would be \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y ~ 1 + x1 + x2 + x3  + [ x4 + x5 ~ z1 + z2 + z3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"submodels\" `y ~ 1 + x1 + x2 +x3 + x4 + x5` and `y ~ 1 + x1 + x2 + x3 + z1 + z2 +z3` are both valid patsy expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard patsy\n",
    "Aside from this change, the standard rules of patsy apply, and so it is possible to use mathematical expression or other patsy-specific features. See the [patsy quickstart](http://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) for some examples of what is possible."
