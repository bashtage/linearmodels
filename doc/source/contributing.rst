Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome.  There are many areas that can be improved that do
not require extensive experience in programming Python:

* Documentation
* Examples
* Docstrings
* Typos in docstrings, examples or documentation

For more experienced programmers, there are some clear opportunities to
refactor the code to share more between the difference classes of models.
These types of simplifications are welcome.

Of course, entire models the expand the package to cover other important
linear models are always welcome.
