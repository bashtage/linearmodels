.. warning::

   Version 5.0 changes the sorting order for models created using formulas.
   Variables will appear in results in the same order they are entered in
   the formula string.


Version 5.0
------------

* Increased minimums:

  - Python: 3.9
  - formulaic: 0.6.1
  - NumPy: 1.19.0
  - SciPy: 1.5.0
  - pandas: 1.1.0
  - statsmodels: 0.12.0

* Switched variable ordering by default.  Importing ``linearmodels.__future__.ordering``
  is a no-op, and has no effect.
* Removed dependence on property-cached in favor of :meth:`functools.cached_property`.
